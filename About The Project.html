    <h2>A decision support system to facilitate, improve and reinforce
         self-management of non-specific low back pain</h2>
    <p>
     
The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app 
in the form of advice for self-management. This advice will be tailored to
each person based on the symptom state and a range of patient characteristics,
including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the
patient.The selfBACK system is a predictive case-based reasoning system, which
is a computer model that is based on existing cases. It is the first of its kind,
utilizing background data about the patient, patient self-monitoring of pain and 
functional ability, along with continuous recording of the patient's physical activity
and sleep by a wristband, to deduce tailored and personalized recommendations for
self-management of low back pain. The wristband will communicate with the developed
smartphone app, which will enable the data analysis and personalised decision support.
With selfBACK, the patient will be equipped with a tool that is far beyond the
state-of-the-artto facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of non-specific
low back pain. A recent study showed that 283 pain-related apps are available in the
main app shops App Store, Blackberry App World, Google Play, Nokia Store and Windows Phone
Store. However, none of these apps have documented effects by scientific publications and
none include a decision support system. It is therefore an urgent need to make personal
device systems available that address health issues with a documented effect. To give a 
general idea of the predicted cost-benefit, we estimate that the total cost of using selfBACK
will range between 120-150 EUR per patient (including the activity detecting wristband, app and
brief education to enable safe use of selfBACK). The effectiveness of selfBACK in preventing
recurrence of episodes with low back pain and disability has yet to be proven but the potential
cost-benefit is without doubt substantial.

    <h3>Workpackages</h3>
    <p><b>WP 1:Data Organisation and Management</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>The main aim of this WP is to collect, organise and provide the data basis for the decision support system.
     Data on the selfBACK server is stored securely, and only authorised requests from the self- management app and
    the co-decision web page will access and update personalised data. Within this WP, the technical and medical teams
    will create the content needed to provide advice for the user. Further, endpoints for querying this data efficiently
    will be created.</p>

<h3>WP 2: Randomised Controlled Trial</h3>
<p><b>Objectives</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The main aim of this WP is to evaluate the effectiveness of selfBACK in self-management of non- specific low back pain.
 UoSD will lead this WP and main partners involved will be NTNU, NFA and GLA. This WP uses input from WP1-4 (phase 1) and
the results will feed heavily into dissemination and exploitation</li></ul>
