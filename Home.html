            <h2>SELFBACK</h2>
            <p>The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain
             is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Moreover, 
             non- specific low back pain is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in
             primary care. Every year, about 1 of 15 people in the European population
             will consult their general practitioner with low back pain. Accordingly, 
             low back pain is one of the most common reasons for activity limitation, 
             sick leave, and work disability.</p>

            <h2>SELFBACK.2</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Current evidence-based guidelines suggest that the most well-documented
             and effective approach to manage non-specific low back pain is to discourage
             bed rest (acute stage), reassure the patient about the favourable prognosis
            (acute stage), advise the patient to stay active both on and off work (acute,
            sub- acute and chronic stage), and advise strength and/or stretching exercise
            (sub-acute and chronic stage). These guidelines have been adopted and refined
            by several European countries to offer the best practice and advice to manage
            low back pain.</p>

            <p>The selfBACK project is a healthcare programme centred round self-management
            and has the potential to save both time and monetary resources in the field of 
            low back pain. The overall aim of the project is to improve the self-management
            of non-specific low back pain in order to prevent chronicity, recurrence and pain-related
            disability. To achieve this we are currently developing a decision support system
            – selfBACK – that will be used by the patients in the self-management of low back pain.
            The patient receives this information through a smartphone app, providing advice to reinforce
            their personalised self-management plan</p>
